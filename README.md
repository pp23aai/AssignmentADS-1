 
# Applied Data Science Assignment 1: Suicide Data Analysis

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for Assignment 1 of the Applied Data Science-1 , focusing on the analysis and visualization of global suicide statistics. This project aims to extract meaningful insights from the data, employing various visualization techniques to elucidate trends and patterns.

## Repository Structure

- **`data_visualization.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook with the complete analysis workflow, from data importation to visualization.

- **`data/`**: Contains the `suicide_data.csv` dataset, the foundational data for this analysis.


## Visualizations

Key visualizations developed in this project include:

- **Line Chart**: Examines the trends in suicide rates over the years, categorized by country.

- **Bar Chart**: Compares suicide rates across different age demographics.

- **Pie Chart**: Illustrates the gender distribution in the suicide data.

## Running the Analysis

To engage with this analysis:

1. Fork the repository at [GitHub - AssignmentADS-1](https://github.com/pp23aai/AssignmentADS-1).

2. Clone your fork to your local system.

3. Install necessary dependencies such as `matplotlib` and `pandas`.

4. Open and run `data_visualization.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment.

## Assignment Objectives

The project is designed to analyze suicide statistics to derive insights across various demographics. The notebook encompasses:

- Importing necessary libraries and loading the dataset.
- Data inspection and cleansing.
- Creation of line, bar, and pie charts for visual analysis.
- Enhancements to visualizations with labels, titles, and colors.
- Interpretation and discussion of the findings from the visualizations.
